# Enforcing, Inferring, and Synthesizing Optional Properties (EISOP) Framework

The Enforcing, Inferring, and Synthesizing Optional Properties (EISOP) Framework project
aims to provide a unified framework for optional properties in Java.

Documentation can be found on the [EISOP Checker Framework](/cf/) homepage.

Releases can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework/releases) and
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/io.github.eisop).

Development occurs in the
[EISOP Checker Framework GitHub project](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework).
The focus in this fork is on soundness and usability.
One (closed-source) user of the EISOP Dataflow Framework reported a 10 percent
reduction in false positives compared to the typetools Dataflow Framework.


## Related projects and tools

More research results can be found on a
[separate page](https://opprop.github.io/).

The [javac diagnostics wrapper](https://github.com/eisopux/javac-diagnostics-wrapper)
is a wrapper around javac to output diagnostics in an easily-configurable way.


## IDE Extensions

We provide several integrations for the EISOP Framework:

* [Checker Framework Language Server](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver/)
* [Checker Framework for VS Code](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-vscode)
* [Checker Framework instructions for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-idea)
* [Checker Framework Support for Eclipse](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-eclipse)
